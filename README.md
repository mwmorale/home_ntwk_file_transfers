# home_ntwk_file_transfers
Easily transfer files between any devices connected to the same (home) network.
Works flawlessly regardless of OS's being used - they may differ between devices without issue!


USE IS VERY SIMPLE...
* The receiver (our "receiver.py") must be running/listening before "sender.py" runs/sends
* These two must be on the same network without VPN's
* Sender must be aware of the receiver's IP when prompted by program to enter
* THE SENDER MUST INPUT PATH TO THIER DESIRED FILE TO SEND (must be hardcoded in source code)
