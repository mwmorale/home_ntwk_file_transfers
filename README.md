# home_ntwk_file_transfers
Easily transfer files between any devices connected to the same (home) network.
Works flawlessly regardless of OS's being used - OS's may differ between devices without issue!


USE IS VERY SIMPLE...
* The receiver (our "receiver.py") must be running/listening BEFORE "sender.py" runs/sends
* These two must be on the same network (without VPN's etc)
* Sender must be aware of the receiver's IP when prompted to enter this
* SENDER MUST INPUT PATH TO THIER DESIRED FILE TO SEND (must be hardcoded in source code of "sender.py")
